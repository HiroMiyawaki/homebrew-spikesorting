homebrew-spikesorting
=====================

homebrew tap that contains formulas for software used in spike sorting, branched from FloFra/spikesorting.

IT STILL HAS ERRRORS AND CAN NOT BE INSTALLED (AT LEAST ON MY OSX)

Just run the following to add these formulas to your homebrew installation:

    brew tap HiroMiyawaki/spikesorting
