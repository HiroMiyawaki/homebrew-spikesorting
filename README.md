homebrew-spikesorting
=====================

homebrew tap that contains formulas for software used in spike sorting, branched from FloFra/spikesorting.

ndmanager, ndmanager-plugins, klustakwik and libklustersshared are installed successfully to my OSX, but there is no warranty.
I didn't tested other formulas, but you can find binaries of klusters and neuroscope (including for OSX) at http://neurosuite.sourceforge.net/

To add these formulas to your homebrew installation, run the following:
    brew tap HiroMiyawaki/spikesorting
